# Books App Exercise

**Requirements:**<br>

✅ 1. Using React, build a webapp that queries this paginated endpoint and prints out the results as a list<br><br>
✅ 2. The app should be paginated (page selector) with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is
refreshed the same resultset is shown)<br><br>
✅ 3. You can use React Bootstrap as a components library for simplicity<br><br>
✅ 4. Compile your own Bootstrap theme (less/sass) with the only difference to the original that the primary
colour is `#1D7874`<br><br>
✅ 5. Host your code on github or similar, put all the code in a Pull Request against the (probably) empty repo<br><br>

**Optional**:<br>

filters:[{type: "all", values: ["YOUR_SEARCH_FIELD_CONTENTS"]}]<br><br>

**Best Effort**:<br>

✅ Classic version (without state management) and Redux + Redux Saga version.<br><br>
✅ Adding ES Lint with Airbnb code style.<br><br>
