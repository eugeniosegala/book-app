# book-app

**Requirements:**<br>
✅ 1. Using React, build a webapp that queries this paginated endpoint and prints out the results as a list<br>
✅ 2. The app should be paginated (page selector) with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is
refreshed the same resultset is shown)<br>
✅ 3. You can use React Bootstrap as a components library for simplicity<br>
✅ 4. Compile your own Bootstrap theme (less/sass) with the only difference to the original that the primary
colour is `#1D7874`<br>
✅ 5. Host your code on github or similar, put all the code in a Pull Request against the (probably) empty repo<br>

**Optional**:<br>

✅ Add a search field to the app that upon request populates the `filters` post param as follows:
filters:[{type: "all", values: ["YOUR_SEARCH_FIELD_CONTENTS"]}]
