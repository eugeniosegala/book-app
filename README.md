# book-app

Requirements:
✅ 1. Using React, build a webapp that queries this paginated endpoint and prints out the results as a list
✅ 2. The app should be paginated (page selector) with the pagination reflected in the url (so when the page is
refreshed the same resultset is shown)
✅ 3. You can use React Bootstrap as a components library for simplicity
✅ 4. Compile your own Bootstrap theme (less/sass) with the only difference to the original that the primary
colour is `#1D7874`
✅ 5. Host your code on github or similar, put all the code in a Pull Request against the (probably) empty repo

**Optional**:

✅ Add a search field to the app that upon request populates the `filters` post param as follows:
filters:[{type: "all", values: ["YOUR_SEARCH_FIELD_CONTENTS"]}]
